#!DOCTYPE
The DOCTYPE declaration in HTML, often referred to as simply the "doctype," is a special instruction that defines the type and version of the HTML document. 
It appears at the very beginning of an HTML document, before the <html> tag. 
The purpose of the doctype declaration is to provide information to the browser or parser about the version of HTML or XML being used in the document.
